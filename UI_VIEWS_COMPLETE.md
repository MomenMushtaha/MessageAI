All 4 views are already referenced in your `ConversationDetailView.swift`:

```swift
// Already integrated:
- showMessageActions → MessageActionsSheet ✅
- showForwardSheet → ForwardMessageView ✅
- showReactionPicker → ReactionPickerView ✅
- typingUsers → TypingIndicatorView ✅
```

**No additional integration needed!** Your code already calls these views. They just needed to be created. ✅
