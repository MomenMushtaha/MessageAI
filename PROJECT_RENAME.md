# Project Renamed to MessageAI

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ App Display Name
- **Changed**: App now displays as **"MessageAI"** on the home screen
- **Implementation**: Added `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName = MessageAI` to Xcode build settings
- **Affects**: Both Debug and Release configurations

### 2. ✅ Bundle Identifier
- **Old**: `LAEF.whatsapp-clone`
- **New**: `LAEF.MessageAI`
- **Impact**: This is the unique identifier for your app in the App Store and on devices

## What Was Changed

### File Modified:
- `whatsapp-clone.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
  - Added `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName = MessageAI` 
  - Changed `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` from `"LAEF.whatsapp-clone"` to `LAEF.MessageAI`
  - Applied to both Debug and Release build configurations

## What Stayed the Same

- **Project folder structure**: Still located in `whatsapp-clone/` directory
- **Xcode project name**: Still `whatsapp-clone.xcodeproj`
- **Scheme name**: Still `whatsapp-clone`
- **Target name**: Still `whatsapp-clone`

> **Note**: Renaming the actual Xcode project files and folders is complex and can break references. The important user-facing name (what appears on the home screen) has been changed to "MessageAI", which is what users will see.

## Verification

✅ Build succeeded with new configuration
✅ Bundle identifier updated: `LAEF.MessageAI`
✅ Display name set to: `MessageAI`

## Next Steps

When you run the app on a simulator or device, it will now show as **"MessageAI"** on the home screen instead of "whatsapp-clone".

### Optional: Rename Firebase Configuration

If you want to update your Firebase project to match:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings
2. Add a new iOS app with bundle ID: `LAEF.MessageAI`
3. Download the new `GoogleService-Info.plist`
4. Replace the existing file in your project

> **Note**: You can keep using the current Firebase configuration with the old bundle ID if you prefer. Firebase will still work correctly.
