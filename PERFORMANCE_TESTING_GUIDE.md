## 📱 Manual Performance Testing

### Test 1: Message Sending Performance
**Goal**: Verify instant message feedback and smooth sending

1. Create or login to a test account
2. Open a conversation (or create a new one)
3. Send a message
4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Message appears INSTANTLY in chat (optimistic UI)
   - ✅ Shows "sending" indicator (clock icon)
   - ✅ Changes to "sent" (checkmark) within 500ms
   - ✅ No UI lag or stuttering

**Performance Metrics to Watch**:
- Perceived latency: 0ms (instant)

1. Open the app on TWO simulators side-by-side:
   - Simulator 1: iPhone 15
   - Simulator 2: iPhone 15 Pro
2. Login as User A on Simulator 1
3. Login as User B on Simulator 2
4. User A sends a message
5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ User B receives message within 1-2 seconds
   - ✅ Smooth animation when message appears
   - ✅ Notification banner shows (if in different conversation)
   - ✅ Message status updates on User A's side (delivered)

**Performance Metrics to Watch**:
- Message propagation: <2s
- Smooth real-time updates
- No UI lag on receive

---

### Test 5: Scroll-to-Bottom Functionality
**Goal**: Verify scroll-to-bottom button works correctly

1. Open a conversation with many messages
2. Scroll to the middle
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Scroll-to-bottom button appears (blue circle with down arrow)
   - ✅ Tap button → smoothly scrolls to bottom
   - ✅ Button disappears when at bottom
4. Send a new message
5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Automatically scrolls to show your new message
   - ✅ Smooth animation

---

### Test 6: Message Status Updates
**Goal**: Test delivered and read receipts

1. User A sends message to User B
2. User B opens the app (but doesn't open conversation)
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ User A sees single checkmark (sent)
   - ✅ After ~1-2s, User A sees double checkmark (delivered)
4. User B opens the conversation
5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ User A sees blue double checkmark (read)
   - ✅ Status updates within 1-2 seconds

---

### Test 7: Offline Behavior
**Goal**: Test offline message handling

1. Enable Airplane Mode on the device/simulator
   - Simulator: Hardware → Network Link Conditioner → 100% Loss
2. Send a message
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Message appears instantly (optimistic UI)
   - ✅ Status shows "sending" (clock icon)
   - ✅ Eventually shows "error" (red background)
4. Disable Airplane Mode
5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Message automatically retries (if implemented)
   - OR shows error state for manual retry

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues Checklist

**If messages are slow to send:**
1. Check network connection
2. Check Firebase console for issues
3. Check Performance Monitor for network latency
4. Look for errors in Xcode console

**If scrolling is laggy:**
1. Check how many messages are loaded (should be limited to 100)
2. Check FPS in Performance Monitor
3. Look for memory warnings
4. Check if status caching is working (should see cache logs)

**If app feels sluggish:**
1. Check memory usage in Performance Monitor
2. Look for repeated error logs
3. Check if too many Firestore listeners are active
4. Restart the app to clear any accumulated state

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Messages stuck in "sending"
- **Cause**: No network connection
- **Fix**: Check network, message will retry when reconnected

**Issue**: Scroll-to-bottom button doesn't appear
- **Cause**: Already at bottom
- **Fix**: Scroll up more than 100 points

**Issue**: Status not updating
- **Cause**: Firestore listener not active
- **Fix**: Close and reopen conversation

## 📝 Logging and Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging
Look for these log messages in Xcode console:

**Message Sending:**
```
📤 Sending message to conversation: {id}
⏱️ Started tracking message send: {messageId}
✅ Message sent to Firestore in {time}ms
📊 Message send completed in {time}ms - Success: true
```

**Performance Metrics:**
```
📊 Message send completed in 245ms - Success: true
✅ Merged 23 messages (Firestore + local)
