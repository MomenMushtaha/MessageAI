## Progress

### Current status
- **MAJOR MIGRATION COMPLETED**: Migrated from Firestore to Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase SDK updated; Realtime Database offline persistence enabled
- Core services refactored (Auth, Chat, Presence, PushNotification)
- Cloud Functions migrated to Realtime Database triggers

### What works (post-implementation)
- ✅ Auth (email/password) with Realtime Database + auto-migration for existing users
- ✅ Presence tracking and last seen with Realtime Database
- ✅ Full messaging with Realtime Database:
  - Send/receive text messages
  - Mark messages as delivered/read
  - Delete messages (for self or everyone)
  - Edit messages (within 15 minutes, with edit history)
  - Message reactions (toggle support)
  - Message forwarding
  - Message pinning/unpinning (max 3 per conversation)
  - Message search (local cache)
  - Pagination (load older messages)
- ✅ Media messages:
  - Image messages with thumbnails
  - Video messages with thumbnails
  - Voice messages with duration
- ✅ Group management:
  - Add/remove participants
  - Make/remove admins
  - Update group info (name, description)
  - Update group avatar
  - Group permissions (admin-only messaging/adding)
  - Leave group
  - Mute notifications
- ✅ Typing indicators (real-time)
- ✅ FCM token storage in Realtime Database
- ✅ Cloud Functions for push notifications
- ✅ Enhanced ConversationDetailView with all features

### What needs testing/completion
- **Database security rules** need to be created for Realtime Database
- **Integration tests** need updating for Realtime Database APIs
- **Full end-to-end testing** of all implemented features
- **AI Insights** (optional feature)

### What's next
- Test all implemented features end-to-end
- Create Realtime Database security rules (`database.rules.json`)
- Update integration tests for Realtime Database
- Optional: Implement AI Insights feature
- Maintain this Memory Bank after significant changes

### Known issues
- Security rules not yet created for Realtime Database (currently in test mode)
- Integration tests need updating for Realtime Database APIs
- Some advanced UI features may need refinement (full-screen media viewer, etc.)
