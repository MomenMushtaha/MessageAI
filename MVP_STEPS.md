## Build & Test Checklist (After Each Step)

```bash
# 1. Build
⌘+B in Xcode

# 2. Run
⌘+R on simulator

# 3. Test
- No crashes
- New features work
- Old features still work

# 4. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Step X: [description]"
git push
```

## Multi-Device Testing Setup

1. Open two simulators:
   - Xcode → Window → Devices and Simulators
   - Boot iPhone 15 Pro (User A)
   - Boot iPhone 15 (User B)

2. Run on both:
   - Select simulator in Xcode
   - ⌘+R to run
   - Repeat for second simulator

3. Test messaging:
   - Create account on each
   - Start conversation
   - Send messages back and forth

## Firestore Console Monitoring

Watch data in real-time:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Firestore Database → View data
4. Watch documents update as you test

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Build fails:**
- Clean build folder: ⌘+Shift+K
- Delete derived data
- Reset package caches

**Messages not syncing:**
- Check Firestore rules (use test mode)
- Check network connection
- Look at Xcode console for errors

**Simulator issues:**
- Reset simulator: Device → Erase All Content and Settings
- Restart Xcode
- Delete app and reinstall

## Time Estimates

- Step 1: 30-45 min
- Step 2: 45-60 min
- Step 3: 60-90 min
- Step 4: 45-60 min
- Step 5: 30-45 min
- Step 6: 45-60 min
- Step 7: 30-45 min
- Step 8: 45-60 min
- Step 9: 60-90 min
- Step 10: 30-60 min

**Total: 10-15 hours**

## Key Architecture Decisions

**Why SwiftData + Firestore?**
- Firestore: Real-time sync, collaborative
- SwiftData: Instant local access, offline support
- Best of both worlds

**Why no APNs for notifications?**
- Requires Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- Requires physical device (not simulator)
- In-app notifications work perfectly for MVP
- Can add later for production

**Why incremental steps?**
- Always have working app
- Easy to test and debug
- Can demo at any point
- Less overwhelming
