5. **Build and test** after each sub-phase
6. **Commit and merge** when phase is complete
7. **Demo the working feature** before moving on
8. **Iterate based on feedback**

---

## Notes

- Each phase builds on previous phases
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
- Write tests alongside features, not after
- Get user feedback early and often
- Document as you go
- Keep the main branch always buildable
- Use feature flags for experimental features
- Monitor performance and costs continuously
