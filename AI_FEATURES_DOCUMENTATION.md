   - Core AI service (singleton)
   - OpenAI API integration
   - 5 core AI features
   - Multi-step agent implementation
   - Caching and performance optimization
   - Mock mode for testing

2. **AIInsightsView.swift** (600+ lines)
   - Main UI for all AI features
   - Tabbed interface
   - All UI components
   - SwiftUI views and layouts

### API Integration:

#### OpenAI Configuration:
```swift
private let openAIAPIKey: String = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
private let openAIBaseURL = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
private let model = "gpt-4o-mini" // Fast and cost-effective
```

#### Features:
- ✅ **Async/Await**: Modern Swift concurrency
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Try/catch with custom errors
- ✅ **Caching**: In-memory cache for 5 minutes
- ✅ **Performance Tracking**: Integrated with PerformanceMonitor
- ✅ **Mock Mode**: Works without API key for testing

### Caching Strategy:

```swift
// 5-minute cache for summaries
private var summaryCache: [String: ConversationSummary] = [:]

// Check cache before API call
if let cached = summaryCache[conversationId] {
    let age = Date().timeIntervalSince(cached.createdAt)
    if age < 300 { // 5 minutes
        return cached
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimization:

1. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple AI calls in parallel
```swift
async let summaryTask = aiService.summarizeConversation(...)
async let actionItemsTask = aiService.extractActionItems(...)
async let decisionsTask = aiService.trackDecisions(...)

let (summary, actionItems, decisions) = try await (
    summaryTask, actionItemsTask, decisionsTask
)
```

2. **Debouncing**: Prevents excessive API calls
3. **Message Limiting**: Analyzes last 100 messages for search
4. **Background Processing**: Heavy work off main thread

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure OpenAI API Key

Open `AIService.swift` and set your API key:

```swift
private let openAIAPIKey: String = "sk-your-actual-key-here"
```

**OR** use environment variables (recommended):

```swift
private let openAIAPIKey: String = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ?? ""
```

### 2. Testing Without API Key

The app includes a **Mock Mode** that works without an API key for testing:

```swift
// AIService.swift automatically falls back to mock responses
guard openAIAPIKey != "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" else {
    return generateMockResponse(for: prompt)
}
```

Mock responses provide realistic data for all features.

### 3. Cost Optimization

Using **GPT-4o-mini** for cost-effectiveness:
- ~10x cheaper than GPT-4
- 2x faster response times
- Excellent quality for these tasks

**Estimated Costs**:
- Summary: ~$0.001 per request
- Action Items: ~$0.002 per request
- Search: ~$0.002 per request
- Priority: ~$0.0005 per message
- Decisions: ~$0.002 per request
- Multi-Step Agent: ~$0.01 per workflow

**Total**: ~$0.05 for full AI analysis of a 100-message conversation
